    <p>
     I am Adriel Mwofoh, a dedicated sophomore at the University of Buea, driven by a profound passion for technology and open source. 
     <br>
     Hailing from the picturesque Grassland region of West Cameroon, I am part of a loving family of six, including my parents, one brother, and two sisters.
     <br>
     My unwavering faith in God and the sacrifice of Jesus Christ fuels my determination and resilience.
     <br> 
     I firmly believe that with faith and perseverance, any challenge can be overcome.
     <br>
     My ethos revolves around discipline, hard work, and consistency, as I strive to achieve excellence in all endeavors.
    <br><br>
     I am a firm believer that there are no unreasonable goals, only unreasonable deadlines. 
     <br>
     With this mindset, I approach every task with determination and a commitment to success.
     <br>
     As a tech enthusiast, I am eager to contribute my skills and passion to a dynamic team, where I can continue to grow and make a meaningful impact.
     <br><br>
     Beyond My academic pursuits, My heart resonates with the soul-stirring rhythms of Gospel music, finding solace and expression through the beat of the drums and aspiring to master the bass.
     <br><br> 
     Adriel's mantra, "I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me," Philippians 4:13.
